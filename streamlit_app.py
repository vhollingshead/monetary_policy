        This capstone demonstrates that monetary policy not only shapes macroeconomic conditions but also plays a measurable role in income inequality. Using ARIMAX models with exogenous variables like the Federal Funds Rate and M2 money supply, we significantly improved Gini coefficient forecasting accuracy. However, these models struggled to capture volatility during periods of economic disruption, such as the COVID-19 shock, underscoring the limits of linear forecasting frameworks under structural breaks.

        For real-time estimation, the LSTM model proved highly effective and achieved a huge improvement over linear regression. Its capacity to model non-linear temporal dependencies between financial indicators and inequality metrics reinforces the value of deep learning in economic forecasting. RandomForestRegressor shows promising performance and opens up the possibility of including supervised learning techniques in effectively capturing temporal dependencies.

        Meanwhile, the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis provided robust causal evidence that U.S. monetary policy contributed to rising inequality, especially relative to Canada. Despite this, traditional monetary levers like interest rates and M2 did not individually emerge as significant predictors in the causal framework, suggesting broader structural dynamics are at play.

        Together, these results highlight that advanced statistical and machine learning models can provide deep insights into complex policy effects. Yet, they also emphasize critical challenges‚Äîsuch as model fragility during volatile periods, difficulty in isolating causality, and the need for continual retraining in dynamic economic contexts. Moving forward, integrating ensemble learning (e.g., Random Forest), modeling real-time shocks, and testing alternate causal frameworks like Regression Discontinuity can further enhance the explanatory and predictive power of policy tools aimed at economic equity.

    st.markdown("<div class='header'>Causal Inference</div>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

    st.markdown("""
    To examine the impact of U.S. monetary policy on income inequality, the analysis employs a series of Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models using Canada as a control group. The core idea is to compare changes in the U.S. Gini coefficient over time‚Äîbefore and after key monetary policy events‚Äîwith corresponding changes in Canada, a country with a similar economic structure but independent monetary policy. By focusing on the interaction between treatment status (U.S. vs. Canada) and time, these models aim to isolate the causal effect of U.S. monetary shifts (such as changes in interest rates or money supply) on income inequality trends.
    
    A baseline DiD model includes just the treatment dummy, time trend, and an interaction term (`DiD_Interaction`), but more refined models introduce monetary policy variables like the U.S. federal funds rate (US_DFF), the interest rate spread between the U.S. and Canada, and both nominal and inflation-adjusted money supply (M2). As models evolve in complexity‚Äîe.g., Model 14 includes interest rate changes, cross-country spreads, and inflation-adjusted M2‚Äîthe results become more robust and the DiD_Interaction term gains strong statistical significance. This suggests that U.S. monetary policy may indeed play a role in shaping inequality trends.
    
    To assess the validity of the parallel trends assumption‚Äîa key requirement for causal inference in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis‚Äîa dynamic event study model was employed. A traditional pre-trend check was not feasible due to missing Gini coefficient data for Canada prior to 1992. Instead, the event study specification evaluates whether the U.S. and Canada followed similar inequality trends leading up to major monetary policy events, particularly around 2008. The interaction term `Treatment:Event_Time` captures the differential trend between the U.S. and Canada over time. In the model, this coefficient is small (0.0245) and statistically insignificant (p = 0.249), indicating no strong evidence of divergence in trends prior to the treatment period.
    
    This supports the parallel trends assumption and reinforces the credibility of Canada as a valid control group. Additionally, the high R-squared (0.977) suggests that the model fits the data well, and the insignificant `Event_Time` term (p = 0.102) further suggests that overall trends were not drastically shifting in the pre-treatment years. Visual inspection of the Gini trends further supports this conclusion, as the U.S. and Canadian series appear to move in parallel throughout the pre-2008 period with no major divergence. While some divergence emerges around 2015‚Äîwith U.S. inequality trending upward and Canada‚Äôs trend flattening or declining‚Äîthis occurs well into the post-treatment period. Since the models estimate treatment effects over the full 1992‚Äì2019 window, such divergence may in fact reflect the very effects being studied, rather than a violation of the parallel trends assumption.

    st.markdown("### üìä DiD Results Summary")

    st.markdown("""
    The sequence of Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models progressively adds monetary policy controls and refinements to isolate the impact of U.S. monetary policy on income inequality.

    Across **Models 3 through 14**, the `DiD_Interaction` term‚Äîrepresenting the treatment effect of U.S. policy changes relative to Canada‚Äîremains **consistently positive and highly statistically significant at the 0.1% level (p < 0.001)** while neither the U.S. federal funds rate (US_DFF) nor the Canadian target overnight rate are individually significant predictors of income inequality.

    - The coefficient of around **0.0037 to 0.0038** across these models is modest but highly consistent, suggesting a **stable treatment effect**.
    - **Model 14** stands out as the **best-performing and most comprehensive** specification.
        - It includes: `DiD_Interaction`, `Year`, US and Canada interest rates, and **inflation-adjusted money supply**.
        - It delivers the **highest t-statistic (49.15)**, low standard error (7.61e-05), and strong significance in both time and treatment terms.

    The significance of inflation-adjusted variables highlights the importance of capturing real purchasing power effects, rather than relying solely on nominal aggregates.

    ### ‚úÖ Conclusion

    The consistent significance of the `DiD_Interaction` term across advanced models provides **strong causal evidence** that U.S. monetary policy contributed to rising inequality compared to Canada. This suggests that even when interest rates and money supply are not significant individually, their **joint structural effects** may play a critical role. 

    This analysis demonstrates that causal methods like DiD are essential in understanding **policy-driven inequality trends**, especially when paired with robust controls and strong parallel trend validation.
