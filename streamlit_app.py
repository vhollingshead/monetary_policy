        st.markdown("""

        - **Time Series Model for Forecasting:** We use a time series model to predict future trends in the Gini coefficient based on monetary policy changes. The model analyzes historical trends and allows users to simulate scenarios, such as adjusting interest rates, to see their impact on inequality over time. Results are visualized in the dashboard, showing both historical and forecasted trends.

        - **Machine Learning Model (LSTM) to Predict the Current Gini**: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of machine learning approach, predict the current Gini coefficient using recent economic data. This provides an up-to-date snapshot of income inequality, which is integrated into the dashboard for real-time insights. By combining forecasting with real-time analysis, the Monetary Policy Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of income inequality dynamics, empowering users to explore both current and future impacts of monetary policy.

        - **RandomForestRegressor to Predict the Current Gini (Future Effort)**: The RandomForestRegressor is an ensemble model composed of multiple trees, with each tree trained on a bootstrapped sample of the training data and random subset of the features. Final predictions are aggregated as a final step. While this model is not represented in the dashboard, it has shown considerable performance improvement over traditional time series and models. We recommend future teams explore supervised learning options like RandomForestRegressor for further analysis. 

        - **Difference-in-Differences (DiD) for Causal Inference**: To assess the causal impact of monetary policy on income inequality, we use a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach. This method compares changes in inequality metrics, like the Gini coefficient, between a treatment group (e.g., regions or groups affected by a specific policy change, such as an interest rate hike) and a control group (e.g., regions or groups not affected) before and after the policy intervention. By isolating the policy’s effect, DiD helps us understand how much of the change in inequality can be attributed to the monetary policy itself, rather than other factors.

    with st.expander("🛠️ Data Pipeline & Preprocessing"):
        st.markdown("""
        - **Data Collection:** We source economic indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), including interest rates, consumer price indices, and asset levels. Financial market data, such as equity indices, is retrieved from Yahoo Finance. Inequality metrics, like the Gini coefficient, are obtained from public datasets (e.g., real-time inequality databases).
        - **Data Types**: We targeted economic variables that fall into the two major categories – Leading and Lagging.  Leading variables can be thought of as levers the federal reserve can pull to trigger a response.  They are often used to make forward-looking decisions.  Lagging variables can be thought of as measurements of economic performance and are often used to confirm economic shifts have occurred.  
        - **Preprocessing**: Multiple datasets are merged into a unified DataFrame, aligning them by date to create a comprehensive time series dataset for analysis.
        - **FRED API**: For the dashboard, data is pulled directly from the FRED database using the public API. Because leading and lagging variables have varying frequencies, they are averaged over the last month, published on the dashboard, and entered to the LSTM model for prediction.
        
        Data preprocessing prepares the raw data for modeling by ensuring consistency and quality. The high-level steps include:
                    
        - **Data Alignment:** Datasets are merged by date, ensuring all time series are synchronized. For example, FRED data (e.g., interest rates) is combined with inequality metrics and financial data.
        - **Frequency Adjustment:** Data is resampled to a consistent frequency (e.g., daily or monthly) to match the analysis requirements, using methods like forward-filling for missing values.
        - **Handling Missing Values:** Missing data points are identified and addressed, either by forward-filling or filtering out incomplete records, to ensure a complete dataset.
        - **Format Conversion:** Dates are converted to a standard datetime format, and the dataset is indexed by date for time series analysis.
        - **Data Split:** Our data was split chronologically (rather than randomly) to retain temporal relationships inherent in the data and to ensure past data was used to make sequential predictions in the future.  In addition, the temporal split establishes a “maximum forecast horizon” that serves as a guideline for model retraining (Hyndman, 2021).

As a first step, we set the index (i) such that the socioeconomic bins were ascended by group (i.e., ordered from the bottom 50% to the middle 40% to the top 10%). We then computed the Gini coefficient while accounting for the population count for each socioeconomic bin. This essentially “weighted” our income share by accounting for the actual population distribution. It is important to note that this approach does not provide the most granular Gini coefficient, but is effective in producing a relative estimate based on limited information.

        While the **RandomForestRegressor** outperformed traditional time series models, we selected **ARIMAX** for forecasting the future gini coefficient and **LSTM** to predict the current gini coefficient for their conventional use in industry and relative strong performance. During the training period of the forecasting model, we compared ARIMA and SARIMAX models for forecasting the Gini coefficient time series, both configured with the same time series order based on ACF and PACF plots. The baseline ARIMA model relied solely on the Gini coefficient data, while SARIMAX incorporated exogenous variables—the effective federal funds rate (DFF) and M2 money supply (M2)—to enhance its predictive power. Based on the performance metrics in Table1 below, ARIMAX outperformed ARIMA, demonstrating that the inclusion of DFF and M2 as exogenous variables significantly improved the model’s ability to capture the dynamics of the Gini coefficient.
        
        During the training period for the model to predict the current gini coefficient, we compared LSTM time series networks with traditional linear regression. Both models used the same feature set—mortgage-backed securities (WSHOMCB), Balance Sheet, Total Assets (QBPBSTASSCMRTSEC), and Consumer Credit, Student Loans (FGCCSAQ027S)—and identical data splits. While linear regression provided a straightforward baseline, the LSTM architecture significantly outperformed it according to metrics in Table 2. The LSTM's ability to capture temporal dependencies and non-linear relationships between economic indicators and inequality proved superior to linear regression's static approach. This demonstrates that the sequential processing capabilities of LSTM networks are particularly valuable for modeling the complex dynamics of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient.  We will describe more details of the model under the “Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)” section below.

        st.markdown("""
        The **forecasting framework** leverages our learned ARIMAX model to predict the Gini coefficient over a multiple-year horizon, starting from the last observed data point. The process involves:


        - **Model Setup**: An ARIMAX model is fitted on the full dataset, using the first-differenced Gini coefficient as the dependent variable and Federal Funds Rate (DFF) and U.S. M2 Money Supply (US_M2_USD) as exogenous variables to capture monetary policy effects.
        - **Future Variables**: Future values of DFF and M2 are estimated using simple assumptions: DFF is scaled based on its last value plus an annual change, while M2 grows at its historical annual rate.
        - **Forecast Output**: The model generates forecasts for the Gini coefficient, including point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

        In our Monetary Policy Dashboard, the ARIMAX model allows users to forecast the Gini coefficient over the next five years by inputting custom monetary policy assumptions, with 95% confidence intervals shaded around the forecast. Users can specify the annual change in the Federal Funds Rate and the annual growth rate of M2, enabling flexible exploration of monetary policy impacts on income inequality.

        We have an example below that demonstrates this forecasting capability, using user-defined inputs where the Federal Funds Rate decreases by 1% annually (annual_dff_change=-1) and M2 grows at an annual rate of 10% (annual_m2_growth_pct=0.1). The historical Gini coefficient (blue line) reflects the trend from 2006 to 2023, showing rising inequality over time, while the forecasted Gini coefficient (red dashed line) projects a continued increase in inequality under these assumptions, with 95% confidence intervals shaded in red.

        To improve model stability and reliability, we applied a weighting adjustment to reduce the influence of the COVID period, which introduced extreme volatility and structural distortions in both macroeconomic variables and the Gini trend. Research has shown that models trained on highly irregular periods can overfit to outliers and fail to generalize well. By incorporating this weighting scheme, the model better reflects long-term macroeconomic relationships rather than transient pandemic-era shocks.
                    
        This example below highlights the dashboard’s ability to simulate user-defined monetary policy impacts on income inequality, though it is not intended to provide specific policy recommendations.

         Our ARIMAX and LSTM models require different retraining frequencies based on economic conditions:

        - **Volatile Periods**: Quarterly retraining becomes necessary during volatility (like COVID-19), when economic relationships shift rapidly and model performance deteriorates within months rather than years.
        - **Trigger Conditions**: To monitor these risks, we propose non-scheduled model retraining when the fed funds rate changes more than 50 basis points in a quarter, and / or the economy experiences significant shifts in M2 money supply (ex: monthly growth rate greater than 1% for 3 or more months in a row).

    with st.expander("📌 Conclusion"):
        st.markdown("""
        This capstone demonstrates that monetary policy not only shapes macroeconomic conditions but also plays a measurable role in income inequality. Using ARIMAX models with exogenous variables like the Federal Funds Rate and M2 money supply, we significantly improved Gini coefficient forecasting accuracy. However, these models struggled to capture volatility during periods of economic disruption, such as the COVID-19 shock, underscoring the limits of linear forecasting frameworks under structural breaks.


        For real-time estimation, the LSTM model proved highly effective and achieved a huge improvement over linear regression. Its capacity to model non-linear temporal dependencies between financial indicators and inequality metrics reinforces the value of deep learning in economic forecasting. RandomForestRegressor shows promising performance and opens up the possibility of including supervised learning techniques in effectively capturing temporal dependencies. 


        Meanwhile, the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis provided robust causal evidence that U.S. monetary policy contributed to rising inequality, especially relative to Canada. Despite this, traditional monetary levers like interest rates and M2 did not individually emerge as significant predictors in the causal framework, suggesting broader structural dynamics are at play.


        Together, these results highlight that advanced statistical and machine learning models can provide deep insights into complex policy effects. Yet, they also emphasize critical challenges—such as model fragility during volatile periods, difficulty in isolating causality, and the need for continual retraining in dynamic economic contexts. Moving forward, integrating ensemble learning (e.g., Random Forest), modeling real-time shocks, and testing alternate causal frameworks like Regression Discontinuity can further enhance the explanatory and predictive power of policy tools aimed at economic equity

    To examine the impact of U.S. monetary policy on income inequality, the analysis employs a series of Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models using Canada as a control group. The core idea is to compare changes in the U.S. Gini coefficient over time—before and after key monetary policy events—with corresponding changes in Canada, a country with a similar economic structure but independent monetary policy. By focusing on the interaction between treatment status (U.S. vs. Canada) and time, these models aim to isolate the causal effect of U.S. monetary shifts (such as changes in interest rates or money supply) on income inequality trends.
    
    A baseline DiD model includes just the treatment dummy, time trend, and an interaction term (`DiD_Interaction`), but more refined models introduce monetary policy variables like the U.S. federal funds rate (US_DFF), the interest rate spread between the U.S. and Canada, and both nominal and inflation-adjusted money supply (M2). As models evolve in complexity—e.g., Model 14 includes interest rate changes, cross-country spreads, and inflation-adjusted M2—the results become more robust and the DiD_Interaction term gains strong statistical significance. This suggests that U.S. monetary policy may indeed play a role in shaping inequality trends.
    
    To assess the validity of the parallel trends assumption—a key requirement for causal inference in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis—a dynamic event study model was employed. A traditional pre-trend check was not feasible due to missing Gini coefficient data for Canada prior to 1992. Instead, the event study specification evaluates whether the U.S. and Canada followed similar inequality trends leading up to major monetary policy events, particularly around 2008. The interaction term `Treatment:Event_Time` captures the differential trend between the U.S. and Canada over time. In the model, this coefficient is small (0.0245) and statistically insignificant (p = 0.249), indicating no strong evidence of divergence in trends prior to the treatment period.
    
    This supports the parallel trends assumption and reinforces the credibility of Canada as a valid control group. Additionally, the high R-squared (0.977) suggests that the model fits the data well, and the insignificant Event_Time term (p = 0.102) further suggests that overall trends were not drastically shifting in the pre-treatment years. Visual inspection of the Gini trends further supports this conclusion, as the U.S. and Canadian series appear to move in parallel throughout the pre-2008 period with no major divergence. While some divergence emerges around 2015—with U.S. inequality trending upward and Canada’s trend flattening or declining—this occurs well into the post-treatment period. Since the models estimate treatment effects over the full 1992–2019 window, such divergence may in fact reflect the very effects being studied, rather than a violation of the parallel trends assumption. Together, the statistical and graphical evidence provide strong justification for using Canada as a control group in the DiD framework.

    The sequence of Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models progressively adds monetary policy controls and refinements to isolate the impact of U.S. monetary policy on income inequality. Across Models 3 through 14, the DiD_Interaction term—representing the treatment effect of U.S. policy changes relative to Canada—remains consistently positive and highly statistically significant at the 0.1% level (p < 0.001) while neither the U.S. federal funds rate (US_DFF) nor the Canadian target overnight rate are individually significant predictors of income inequality. This suggests robust evidence that inequality in the U.S. increased more than in Canada following monetary policy shifts. The coefficient of around 0.0037 to 0.0038 across these models, while modest in magnitude, is precise and consistent, pointing to a stable treatment effect across various model specifications and control variables.

    Among the models, Model 14 stands out as the best-performing and most comprehensive specification. It includes not only the DiD interaction and time trend (Year), but also U.S. and Canadian interest rates (US_DFF, Canada_Overnight_Target_Rate), log of inflation-adjusted US money supply and log of Canada money supply. This model yields the highest t-statistic (49.15) for the DiD term, a low standard error (7.61e-05), and significance in the Year variable as well (p < 0.01), indicating that both the time dimension and treatment effect are driving variation in inequality. Moreover, this model includes real (inflation-adjusted) monetary aggregates, which add important explanatory power by capturing the purchasing power dynamics of monetary policy—something nominal M2 measures miss.
                
    The consistent significance of the DiD_Interaction term across all advanced models (Models 3–14) provides strong evidence that U.S. monetary policy had an effect on income inequality, compared to Canada, a similar developed economy not directly affected by Federal Reserve policy. On the other hand, the Federal Funds Rate and M2 were not significant drivers, suggesting that broader economic factors contributed to inequality changes, rather than just monetary policy alone.
